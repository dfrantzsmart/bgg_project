## Clean Code:

- Code follows PEP-8
- Very readable and easy to follow
- Great job using python functions for web scraping. Reminder- include docstrings at the beginning to help the reader understand the inputs and purpose of these functions
- In future projects, try to create functions and py files for your modeling process.

## Good Documentation:

- Good & informative README.md. In the results section you mentioned the features you focused on- name and define them so the reader clearly understand
- Markdown cell at beginning of .ipynb explains scope and analyis
- Could use more markdown cells throughout as section headings and explaining decisions made

## Proper Data Science:

- Nice use of masks for filtering
- Code demonstrates good Python understanding, efficient use of Pandas with good syntax, and great matplotlib proficiency
- Great analysis and depth of exploration at station, weekly, and hourly level
- Good visualizations -- not too much info, clear and interpretable. Love the busiest stations highlighted in orange on gray, very effective way to highlight relevant info.

## Comments:

- Good job on project 2! :)
- Inputting data can be a nightmare. Good to see you tried as many approaches as possible. This is typical data scientist methodology. Good work!
- Love the approach/project design of the project. 
- Feature engineering-after boot camp would love to see if you can do feature interactions.
